//! Cross-validation tests (Phase 11.2).
//!
//! These close three cross-crate invariants that were deliberately *deferred*
//! when their owning crates were written, each because the owning crate must
//! not depend on the other:
//!
//! 1. **`MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` equality** (flagged in Phase 4, `climb-dns`).
//!    `climb-dns` deliberately does not depend on `climb-mtl` (a normal
//!    dependency would drag bindgen + native-lib linking into every pure-DNS
//!    consumer and break `cargo test -p climb-dns` on machines without
//!    `.mtl-install`).  So it duplicated the bound as a documented constant.
//!    This test — which lives in `climb-bench`, the one crate that already
//!    depends on both — asserts the two constants are equal.
//!
//! 2. **`DatasetSize` equality** (flagged in Phase 9, `climb-analytical`).
//!    `climb-analytical` deliberately does not depend on `climb-dns`, so it
//!    duplicated the enum.  This test asserts every variant's leaf count
//!    matches between the two enums.
//!
//! 3. **`DatasetSize` value bounds** — the `DatasetSize` variants' counts must
//!    stay within a `u16`-addressable message (the native signing path takes
//!    message lengths as `uint16_t`), which ties the duplicated enum back to
//!    the duplicated length constant.
//!
//! `climb-bench` is the correct home because it is the only crate in the
//! workspace permitted to depend on `climb-dns`, `climb-analytical`, and
//! `climb-mtl` simultaneously — the integration layer is exactly where
//! cross-crate contracts belong.
